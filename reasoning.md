# Turn 2 Reasoning Notes

- Reviewed metadata headers across API, UI, schema, and infrastructure assets to guarantee required fields (version, turns, date) remained accurate.
- Ensured documentation and agentic pipeline artifacts reflect turn 2 scope, including changelog/version history updates and new manifest/ADR entries.
- Validated package-lock files by diffing post-install state to confirm no regeneration was necessary before rerunning automated tests.

# Turn 1 Reasoning Notes

- Selected the **full-stack-app-nextjs-nestjs** pattern to guide repository structure and conventions.
- Created shared schema artifacts first to align API, UI, and database representations.
- Scaffolded the NestJS API with TypeORM entities, DTO validation, and tests using repository mocks to avoid heavy DB dependencies.
- Implemented a Next.js app with a controlled registration form, Tailwind styling, and Jest tests for validation flows.
- Added migrations, seed scripts, documentation, and agentic pipeline artifacts to satisfy project governance requirements.
