#### Task
TASK 12 – Docker Compose for DB and API
#### Changes
- Created `infra/docker-compose.yml` and `infra/.env` to provision PostgreSQL and the NestJS API with health checks and shared credentials.
- Added `api/.env.local.example` and an API `Dockerfile` so developers can align local configuration with the Compose stack.

#### Task
TASK 13 – Makefile for DB, Migrations, App, and Compose
#### Changes
- Authored a top-level `Makefile` that wraps Docker Compose lifecycle commands, TypeORM migrations, and application scripts without environment fallbacks.

#### Task
TASK 14 – Create README.md for API
#### Changes
- Rebuilt `api/README.md` with end-to-end setup, configuration, troubleshooting, and documentation guidance aligned to the Makefile and Compose workflow.
- Relocated REST client `.http` definitions to `api/rest-tests/` and refreshed metadata headers to match governance requirements.

#### Tooling & Operations
- npm run lint *(fails: missing optional dependency `@eslint/eslintrc` in current environment)*
