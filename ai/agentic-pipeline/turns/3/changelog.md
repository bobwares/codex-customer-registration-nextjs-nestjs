#### Task
TASK 06 - Create TypeORM Configuration
#### Changes
- Implemented a shared `AppDataSource` that reads from `ai/context/.env`, applies the snake-case naming strategy, and registers all customer entities alongside compiled migration globs.
- Added TypeORM CLI scripts, a connection validation helper, and documented the migration workflow in `api/README.md`.
- Wired `AppModule` to reuse the centralized TypeORM options and expanded `.gitignore` to exclude build metadata.

#### Task
TASK 07 — Create Domain Entities
#### Changes
- Created TypeORM entities, view, and repositories for customers, emails, phone numbers, postal addresses, and privacy settings with metadata headers.
- Added a customer domain module plus a repository-backed service that performs transactional create, read, update, and delete operations.
- Authored the initial migration to create the customer schema, tables, constraints, and reporting view.

#### Tooling & Operations
- npm run build
- npm run lint
