#### Task
TASK 04 - Create DB from Schema
#### Changes
- Translated the persisted customer JSON schema into a PostgreSQL 16 migration with normalized tables, foreign keys, indexes, and a flattened reporting view under the `customer_domain` schema.
- Generated the Draft 2020-12 entity schema (`ai/context/schemas/customer_domain-entities.json`) from the canonical SQL to keep downstream tooling aligned with the database shape.

#### Task
TASK 05 - Create set of test data
#### Changes
- Authored an idempotent seed script that loads ten representative customers plus supporting addresses, privacy settings, emails, and phone numbers.
- Documented migration and seeding workflows in `db/README.md` including smoke-test queries for validation.

#### Tooling & Operations
- No automated tests were executed for this database-only turn; validation occurs via the documented SQL smoke tests.
