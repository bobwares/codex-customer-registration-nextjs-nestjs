# Ensure Metadata and Agentic Artifact Compliance

**Status**: Accepted

**Date**: 2025-09-18

## Context
Turn 2 focuses on verifying that the previously generated full-stack assets conform to repository governance requirements. Every source, test, and infrastructure file must maintain metadata headers, and the agentic pipeline requires up-to-date changelog, ADR, and manifest artifacts per turn.

## Decision
Performed a repository-wide metadata spot-check, refreshed documentation (version history, changelog, reasoning), and created new turn-specific agentic artifacts (changelog, ADR, manifest). Package-lock files were validated to confirm dependency state without regeneration.

## Consequences
- Positive: Documentation and governance records accurately capture turn 2 activity, and metadata headers remain synchronized for future automation.
- Positive: Verified lockfiles ensure deterministic installs for subsequent contributors.
- Negative: Manual metadata audits add operational overhead until automated checks are introduced.
