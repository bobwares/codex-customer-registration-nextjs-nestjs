This repository follows the Codex agentic pipeline. Turn 1 provisions the NestJS backend skeleton that future turns will extend.

## Backend (NestJS)
- Located in [`backend/`](backend/)
- Provides the mandated NestJS 11 scaffold with validation, ESLint, and testing setup.
- Key npm scripts: `npm run build`, `npm run lint`, `npm test`

## Agentic Pipeline Artifacts
Artifacts for each turn live under [`ai/agentic-pipeline/turns/`](ai/agentic-pipeline/turns/). Turn 1 captures the changelog, ADR, manifest, and logs for reproducibility.
